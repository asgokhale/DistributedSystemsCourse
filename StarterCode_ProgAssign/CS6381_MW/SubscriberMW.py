# Designing the logic is left as an exercise for the student. Please see the
# PublisherMW.py file as to how the middleware side of things are constructed
# and accordingly design things for the subscriber side of things.
#
# Remember that the subscriber middleware does not do anything on its own.
# It must be invoked by the application level logic. This middleware object maintains
# the ZMQ sockets and knows how to talk to Discovery service, etc.
#
# Here is what this middleware should do
# (1) it must maintain the ZMQ sockets, one in the REQ role to talk to the Discovery service
# and one in the SUB role to receive topic data
# (2) It must, on behalf of the application logic, register the subscriber application with the
# discovery service. To that end, it must use the protobuf-generated serialization code to
# send the appropriate message with the contents to the discovery service.
# (3) On behalf of the subscriber appln, it must use the ZMQ setsockopt method to subscribe to all the
# user-supplied topics of interest. 
# (4) Since it is a receiver, the middleware object will maintain a poller and even loop waiting for some
# subscription to show up (or response from Discovery service).
# (5) On receipt of a subscription, determine which topic it is and let the application level
# handle the incoming data. To that end, you may need to make an upcall to the application-level
# object.
