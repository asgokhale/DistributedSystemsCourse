# This dockerfile creates an image to run our Python program
# that serves as the client program to talk to the ZooKeeper server.
#
# The FROM keyword tells the build process what the base image is
# from which to start building. We use Ubuntu 20.04
FROM ubuntu:focal  
#
# The RUN directive is used to customize the image with
# whatever packages we want to install as well as any other
# modifications, configurations we want to do
#
# Install the needed packages. The "-y" eliminates the interactive response
# We first install the key packages we need like Java and Python3
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y default-jdk python3
#
# Then we install Pip3 upgrading it to the latest version in case any python
# packages are needed to be installed
RUN apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-pip
RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
#
# Install the Kazoo package
RUN python3 -m pip install --upgrade kazoo
#
#
# Now we install some utilities just in case we need to debug from
# inside the pod/container.
RUN apt-get install -y net-tools wget dnsutils iputils-ping iputils-tracepath iputils-arping iputils-clockdiff
#
# Tell Docker what is going to be our working directory instead of the / directory
# by default. By specifying the directory, if one does not exist, it will be created.
WORKDIR /work
#
# Now let us keep our python program inside this image.
# For this we use the COPY directive that copies code from host to this image
# into the working directory
COPY zkclient.py .
#
# If we were to run Docker images natively, then one could provide the
# command to run when the docker image is executed. But here we skip
# that step and instead let K8s take care of it
