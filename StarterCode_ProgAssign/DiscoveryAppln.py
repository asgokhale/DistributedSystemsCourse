# This is left as an exercise for the student.  The Discovery service is a server
# and hence only responds to requests. It should be able to handle the register,
# is_ready, the different variants of the lookup methods. etc.
#
# The key steps for the discovery application are
# (1) parse command line and configure application level parameters. One
# of the parameters should be the total number of publishers and subscribers
# in the system.
# (2) obtain the discovery middleware object and configure it.
# (3) since we are a server, we always handle events in an infinite event loop.
# See publisher code to see how the event loop is written. Accordingly, when a
# message arrives, the middleware object parses the message and determines
# what method was invoked and then hands it to the application logic to handle it
# (4) Some data structure or in-memory database etc will need to be used to save
# the registrations.
# (5) When all the publishers and subscribers in the system have registered with us,
# then we are in a ready state and will respond with a true to is_ready method. Until then
# it will be false.
