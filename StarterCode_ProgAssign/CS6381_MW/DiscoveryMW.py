# Designing the logic is left as an exercise for the student.
#
# The discovery service is a server. So at the middleware level, we will maintain
# a REP socket binding it to the port on which we expect to receive requests.
#
# There will be a forever event loop waiting for requests. Each request will be parsed
# and the application logic asked to handle the request. To that end, an upcall will need
# to be made to the application logic.
