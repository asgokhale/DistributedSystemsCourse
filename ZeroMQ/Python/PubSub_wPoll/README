This code has been modified from the original pub-sub code
to showcase the use of poller. It has also been modified
to make it object oriented by using class in the subscriber.

Here the subscriber contains three SUB sockets, each subscribing to a
separate topic. The topics are a string tuple of the form "temp:<value>"
or "humidity:<value>" or "pressure:<value>". Default values are
temp:70, humidity:50 and pressure:30.

The subscriber uses the poller to poll and understand which socket is
enabled if the condition matches. If there is data, then a callback is made
to simply receive the actual info and print it. This is a crude form of the
"notify" logic that is expected in the Assignment.

Publisher randomly generates some values for the topics. It also randomly
decides which category of topic it wants to publish.

To run the code locally in your VM, open two bash shells. In one shell, type
python3 publisher.py and in the second type "python3 subscriber.py".

Subscriber supports command line args to override the default temperature,
humidty and pressure values of interest.

To try the code on Mininet, run mininet as follows:

sudo mn -x

this will create a two host topology

In h1, run
   python3 publisher.py

In h2, run
   python3 subscriber.py 10.0.0.1
