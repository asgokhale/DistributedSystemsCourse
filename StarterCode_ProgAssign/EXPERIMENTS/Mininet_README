# Note: I could not include these comments in the commands file
# Hence, had to create this separate README
#
# now run each instance. The > redirects standard output to the
# named file after it, and then the 2> redirects the standard error
# to the arg named after it, which happens to the same file name
# as where we redirected the standard output. The final & is to
# push the command into the background and let it run.
#
# Note that because we are now running these applications on
# Mininet hosts, each host has a different IP address and so
# we need to provide the appropriate params
#
# Here, I am going to create a topology like this:
# sudo mn --topo=single,10
#
# You can use such a logic and additional params to create
# all kinds of mininet topologies and experimental scenarios.
