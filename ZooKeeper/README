I am assuming you are trying this out on your Ubuntu guest VM (some
Linux box)

Download and install the Apache ZooKeeper binary distribution. As of
Feb 2021, the released version is 3.6.2

To run this sample code, you will need to install the kazoo package.

To install it systemwide (and to prevent some warnings), we do

   sudo -H python3 -m pip install --upgrade kazoo

Start the zookeeper server
--------------------------------
First start the zookeeper server. A configuration file is needed for the
ZooKeeper server to run.

cd <path to your apache-zookeeper-3.6.2-bin> directory
cd conf
cp zoo_sample.cfg zoo.cfg
cd ..
./bin/zkServer.sh start

(this will start the server as a daemon process in background)

CLI-based client
------------------
In a shell,

cd <path to your apache-zookeeper-3.6.2-bin> directory
./bin/zkCli.sh

(this will start the CLI client connecting to our server on the localhost)

Programmatic Clients (run them in a separate shell)
---------------------------------------------------------
SimpleClientServer:
        Demonstrates a simple sequence of commands that the client executes
        on the ZooKeeper server. To verify what the program-based client is doing,
        you an open a shell and run the interactive shell (zkClient.sh) and check
        the znodes that are getting created in ZooKeeper.

BarrierSingleProcess:
        Shows a ZooKeeper recipe for barrier synchronization
