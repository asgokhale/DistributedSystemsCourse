Demonstrates a simple client server session with ZooKeeper using programmatic
API. This will be useful for the programming assignment.

Make sure to have started the ZooKeeper server before invoking the client as follows:

 shell prompt>    <your Zookeeper installation dir>/bin/zkServer.sh start

Client is to be started as follows:

python3 zkclient.py [-a <ip addr of server>] [-p <port that server listens on>]

Where the IP address and port num are optional. By default localhost is taken
as the IP address and 2181 is the port number.

We can easily run this code inside of mininet also.
