# This is left as an exercise to the student. Design the logic in a manner similar
# to the PublisherAppln. As in the publisher application, the subscriber application
# will maintain a handle to the underlying subscriber middleware object.
#
# The key steps for the subscriber application are
# (1) parse command line and configure application level parameters
# (2) obtain the subscriber middleware object and configure it.
# (3) As in the publisher, register ourselves with the discovery service
# (4) since we are a subscriber, we need to ask the discovery service to
# let us know of each publisher that publishes the topic of interest to us. Then
# our middleware object will connect its SUB socket to all these publishers
# for the Direct strategy else connect just to the broker.
# (5) Subscriber will always be in an event loop waiting for some matching
# publication to show up. We also compute the latency for dissemination and
# store all these time series data in some database for later analytics.
