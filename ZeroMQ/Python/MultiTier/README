This code demonstrates the use of REQ-REP sockets used in a multi tier
architecture, where the original client sends some dummy requests to
its next tier, which then forwards to the next and so on. On the return path
acknowledgments are sent back.

Some of this will be useful in our understanding of how messages are
propagated from one node to another say in a DHT ring.

We can test different scenarios to see if we can get this work as expected.
If everything is on localhost, make sure to use use different port numbers
for each tier server. If on different hosts on mininet, they can each keep
using the default 4444 port number but still make sure that the names
used are unique so that we can be sure from the printed output that the
chain is working correctly.

For both cases below, we need say 7 hosts if everything needs to work
on different nodes. To that end, we can do "sudo mn --topo=single,7"

------------------------------------------------
Case 1:  Shared last tier
------------------------------------------------
Mininet host names shown above or below the peer's name

C1 ------------> Tier1.1 ----------------> Tier 2.1
                                                                   \
                                                                    \
                                                                      Tier3.1
                                                                    /    h7
                                                                   /
C2-------------> Tier1.2 ----------------> Tier 2.2
h2                     h4                              h6

-->You can add more clients



------------------------------------------------
Case 2:  Shared intermediate tier
------------------------------------------------
Note that because ZMQ load balances requests, Tier2.1 will
relay incoming requests in round robin to the third tier servers.

h1                     h3                         h6
C1 ------------> Tier1.1                 Tier 3.1
                                 \              /
                                  \            /
                                    Tier2.1
                                  /    h5    \
                                 /              \                                                    
C2-------------> Tier1.2                 Tier 3.2
h2                     h4                          h7

-->You can add more clients

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 3:  Fanout from the client plus shared tier
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Like case 2 but now clients have a fanout and ZMQ will
send requests in round robin fashion to tier1 servers.

             h3                         h6
         Tier1.1                 Tier 3.1
       /            \              /
     /               \            /
C1                   Tier2.1
h1  \              /    h5    \
       \            /              \                          
         Tier1.2                 Tier 3.2
            h4                          h7

-->You can add more clients (our case 3 has 4 clients)
