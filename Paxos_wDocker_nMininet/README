===========================================================
Purpose:
-------------
This is a homegrown implementation of a single decree Paxos algorithm. The idea is to use this
for students to play with as a group and try out different scenarios.

The code can be used in a mininet env, on a laptop or across distributed resources as long as
network connectivity exists
===========================================================

Files:

proposer.py
        Implements the proposer and learner logic
acceptor.py
        Implements the acceptor logic

Design
---------

Uses ZeroMQ and its PUSH-PULL Divide and Conquer pattern. Currently, network delays are emulated
using sleep () calls. But eventually we would like to use netem or tc.
