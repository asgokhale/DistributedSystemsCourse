# The core logic of the publisher application will be as follows
# (1) The publisher app decides which all topics it is going to publish.
# For this assignment, we don't care about the values etc for these topics.
#
# (2) the application obtains a handle to the lookup/discovery service using
# the CS6381_MW middleware APIs so that it can register itself with the
# lookup service. Essentially, it simply delegates this activity to the underlying
# middleware publisher object.
#
# (3) Register with the lookup service letting it know all the topics it is publishing
# and any other details needed for the underlying middleware to make the
# communication happen via ZMQ
#
# (4) Keep periodically checking with the discovery service if the entire system is
# initialized so that the publisher knows that it can proceed with its periodic publishing.
#
# (5) Start a loop on the publisher for sending of topics
#
#       In each iteration, the appln decides (randomly) on which all
#       topics it is going to publish, and then accordingly invokes
#       the publish method of the middleware passing the topic
#       and its value. 
#
#       Note that additional info like timestamp etc may also need to
#       be sent and the whole thing serialized under the hood before
#       actually sending it out. Use Protobuf for this purpose
#
#
# (6) When the loop terminates, possibly after a certain number of
# iterations of publishing are over, proceed to clean up the objects and exit
#

# import the needed packages
import os     # for OS functions
import sys    # for syspath and system exception
