This directory contains plan socket-based client-server code. Server computes
factorial. 

* client.cpp is the client side code
* iterative_server.cpp is the server side code that handles one client at a time.
* concurrent_server.cpp is the server side code that can handle multiple clients
   at a time.

Running the code:
-------------------------

In one shell run either of:

./iterative_server

or

./concurrent_server

and observe the port number on which the server is running.

In another shell, run the client as follows:

./client <server ip address> <server port num> <num> <iterations>

where num is the number whose factorial you are interested in, and iterations
is how many times the client will send the same request to the server and
receive a reply. Each iteration is timed and you will see how much time it
takes to serve each request.
